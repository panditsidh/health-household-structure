\title{Pregnant women's health and health decision making in Indian households}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

Health during pregnancy matters for both women and their children.  The ability to make decisions about your own healthcare may have positive consequences for health and is a good in itself.  

Both theory (modernization theory) and evidence (Allendorf, 2012) suggest a trend towards nuclear households in India.  Scholars have long associated nuclear households with more autonomy for women (cite Jeffreys, others).  

This paper investigates trends in household structure among pregnant women in India in 3 rounds of the NFHS.  Contrary to the modernization literature, we find an increasing proportion of pregnant women live in patrilocal joint households, and that a shrinking proportion live in nuclear households.  The proportion living in natal households remained stable between 2005 and 2020.  

The primary contribution of this paper is to investigate the consequences of this demographic shift for pregnant women's health and health care decision making.  We further point researchers interested in understanding the causes of increasing co-residence of pregnant women with their in-laws towards some possible candidate explanations.

The increase in joint patrilocal households seems not to have had negative consequences for women's decision making about their own health care.  Pregnant women's autonomy as measured by their say in healthcare decisions has increased significantly in all household types, and gaps have narrowed. Women in joint patrilocal are now only x\% pp less likely to report say in their own decisions than women in nuclear households, compared to X\% in 2005.

Consistent with the prior literature which studied trends in the 1990s and early 2000s, we find some health advantages of joint patrilocal living: women in joint patrilocal households have greater dairy consumption and are less likely to experience physical violence by their husbands.  (BMI?)  Another difference, which we investigate in further detail, is that recently delivered women living in joint patrilocal households are more likely to give birth in private facilities than those living in nuclear households.  This is consistent with them living in wealthier households.

Despite families' likely assumptions that more costly care is better care, joint families' choice of private providers may actually be harmful for pregnant women and children in parts of the country where private providers have worse outcomes than public providers.  (summary of an analysis about neonatal or early neonatal death regressed on household type for different regions, control for facility type, see if it disappears.  Try the same for csection in south...)

Given that the demographic trends that appear to be contributing to an increase in joint family living for pregnant women seem likely to continue (cite the other paper), and that nuclear families will get richer and be more likely to be able to afford private care, a policy recommendation is to positively norm pregnant women being capable of making their own decisions, while educating everyone in pregnant women's households about what good delivery care looks like (qualified provider, less intervention).
